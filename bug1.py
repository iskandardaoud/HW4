# bug1.pyfrom shape import Shape

    main()
In this revised code, we have organized the classes and imports correctly. The "Shape" class is defined in the "shape.py" module, and the "Circle" class inherits from it in the "circle.py" module. The "bug1.py" file imports the necessary classes and functions, and it should run without errors.

Make sure your code files are organized in this way, and the circular import issue should be resolved.
